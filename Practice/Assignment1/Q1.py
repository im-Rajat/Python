"""
1. Write a Python program that has a member function Sum inside class. This function will have array_numbers and target_sum as input to them. This function should find index of the consecutive two numbers from input array_numbers , addition of which should match the input target_sum. This function will return index of that two consecutive numbers.

For e.g.
Input: array_numbers= [10,20,10,40,50,60,70], target_sum=50 Output: 3, 4
